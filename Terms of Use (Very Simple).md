I Hassan as the owner of thses projects give you permission to use these projects however you like with no limitations.

You don't have to credit me on your projects, although it would be much appreciated if you do.

I provide these projects with no warranty of any kind at all, so I have no responability on how you use these projects and their potential outcome whatever it might be, so use these projects knowning that you are the one held responsible for your  own actions.

Please dont try to host my projects on your own site and give driect download links from your server, however you can put my github repo link in your website (https://github.com/TheXpertCoder/Exercise-Files) that is totally fine by me.

and lastly please DON'T SELL MY PROJECTS as they are free for everyone to use.


You agree to this agreement when decide to use any of my projects.
